The whiz kids from that three letter agency called. They can't dedicate more time to this operation, but before they tackle their next cyberwar operation, they made the following comment: 

"Huh that's funny, each obfuscation operation starts and ends with the same push push pop pop pattern. One is l33t the other is DEAD. What a bunch of nerds! Searching for that pattern would help locate all the obfuscated functions all at once. The rest would just be applying the reverse algorithm...." 

We're not too sure what they meant by that, but that's better than nothing. Good luck champ, you've got it. We're counting on you!
