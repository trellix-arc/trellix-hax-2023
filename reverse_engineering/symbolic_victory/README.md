## Description
We recently discovered an important control system situated on the other side of the U.S., which governs their distribution of clean, desalinated water. It runs a simple administration service to control the system, where a user provides an encoded program which is decoded and executed by the server. Unfortunately, none of the encoded "programs" we have tried supplying via the prog URL parameter produced any meaningful insight, although one of them, 94e4bf5088964919a2da59aca20c7666afb28d1f9cd899bba825bc1a7237bc22560de5f0 results in an error. If we had the decoding key maybe we could supply our own programs later...

Our double-agent just delivered the binary which decodes these programs under the hood. Time to get busy!
