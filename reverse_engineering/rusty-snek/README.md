## Description
The counterespionage group identified a mole within our ranks who had been leaking key data relating to your infrastructure to the other side. A conventional forensic scan of the his networked devices identified no irregular files, other than this odd "game." It is presumed to be a mechanism for communication with his opposite-coast handlers. We have a feeling that, if you beat the game, you will receive the message.

## Hint
The hint is in the file "challenge/.hint"
