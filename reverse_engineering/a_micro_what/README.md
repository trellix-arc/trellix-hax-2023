### 400 Points

## Description
A very small gadget was found inside a briefcase which had had been stashed in an abandoned lot near the region's last operational airport. This device looks to be some sort of microcontroller. We were able to boot it up and connect to the USB port to which it asked for a "Password". While our researchers were pulling the flash off of it they seemed to break the device... Now all we have is this flash dump. Can you recover what is hidden behind the password prompt?
