# Spying through the webdoor

### 100 Points

## Description
Our adversaries managed to compromise one of the hosts under territorial management. It was well-isolated from the core network, and initially declared inconsequential, until a SOC analyst discovered a backdoored webserver lurking in the tmp directory. You must reverse engineer the backdoor to recover whatever information you can about their tactics, including the key used to establish remote access to the host.
