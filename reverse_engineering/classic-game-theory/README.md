## Description
The nukes set us back to the stone age in more ways than one. Yeah, infrastructure is virtually non-existent and what's left of the internet is little more than a museum, but more than that it's made those lucky enough to stick around nostalgic for the old days — before whatever combination of tech and culture and social conditions led us here. When you're not hacking on the latest and greatest, you and your friends trade cassette mixtapes and ancient freeware games - cherished treasures from an era before every piece of media required being plugged in. If anyone needed the good stuff, they went to Kat. Your best friend.

It's been a while since you've seen her. Shortly after rumors started circulating about her spying for the other side, she vanished under mysterious circumstances, leaving behind all her tech, including her old laptop. The crew has been trying to break into it to see if it has any evidence regarding her location or — heaven forbid — her covert operations for the enemy. What you haven't told them is that you're almost certain you've got the password sitting on your desk in the form of a floppy disk she gave you shortly before her disappearance. The only thing on it was an unheard-of text-based adventure game called "ARC," but you haven't been able to get past the first screen. That changes today.
