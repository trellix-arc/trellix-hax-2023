# Stacks on Stacks

### 500 Points

## Description
Wanting to understand how the leak could have happened, our side's remaining security researchers started looking through the files that were left behind. During this process, they noticed that the hash of the old government's custom bytecode VM did not match the expected values... Upon further analysis, they realized that it had been tampered with and, when given a certain program, the VM would output a message. Can you help up figure out how to trigger that message?

## Hint
You can use more stacks than you need for printing the flag.
