## Description
You, your cohorts, and a double-agent deep behind enemy cyber-lines are close to completing an attack chain which, in theory, would allow you to cripple large swaths of the opposing coast's regional communication system. Cobbled together as it is with what meager wireless technology remained functional after that terrible day in 2024, the enemy's internet infrastructure, on which virtually all of its state operations depend, is slow, weak, and all they have. Taking down even 10% of this network would set the organizational efforts of the opposite coast back months, and bring your own side closer to unilateral control over what is left of the American heartland.

To complete the attack chain, you must pivot to a media connector from which your malware can access key backend components governing the entire communications system. Your spy on the inside has managed to pass along a fragment of traffic between the target device and a network administrator. She also provided model information in detail sufficient to narrow down the version of firmware likely running on the device. Fortunately, this firmware file was still available online!

Armed with these two artifacts, you must find a way to achieve code execution on the media connector and avail yourself of the flag!
