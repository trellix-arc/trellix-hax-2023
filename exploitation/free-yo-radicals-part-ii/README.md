# Free_Yo_Radicals_Part_ii 

### 400 Points

## Description
The other side has noticed our presence on their server and have removed the call to the "print_flag" function. Using the knowledge you gained in Part I, attempt to find any possible vulnerabilities in the way the opposing side's developers implemented the server-side processing of the protocol. Once you've identified these vulns, your task will be to craft a remote exploit which can be used to execute the “print_flag” function. Doing so will bring us one step closer to establishing persistence on this system, and ensuring we have the intel we need to prevent exposing our scouts to dangerous radiation.
