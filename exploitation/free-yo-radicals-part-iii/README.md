### 500 Points

## Description
The other side's developers identified your previous exploitation of their binary, so they hardened the system further by adding all the mitigations they could think of and stripping out symbols. Since we still need code execution on this system to map out regions safe for us to expand into, we need you to overcome the extra protections. Determine if their mitigation strategy truly addressed the root cause of the original issue and if there is a way to still exploit this system to print the “print_flag” function.
