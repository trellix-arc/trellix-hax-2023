### 100 Points

## Description
Our large-scale scans of possible networked machines used by the opposite coast have produced an interesting result: an unprotected repository which bears the same telltale fingerprint of known enemy hosts. However, the contents of the repository appear to be arbitrary, lacking in any significance... A honeypot, perhaps? You'd better have a poke around this system, just to make sure.

## Hint
The checksum seems to be the only tool with user input. When playing around with it don't forget about URL character encoders.
